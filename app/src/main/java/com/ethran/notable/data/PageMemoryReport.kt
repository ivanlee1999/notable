 * The three pools [PageDataManager] manages are deliberately kept apart here too — they are evicted
 * by different rules and, more importantly, they don't even live in the same heap:
 * - [entryBytes] / [entryCapBytes] — stroke+image page data, the line that drives page eviction.
 *   **Java heap.**
 * - [backgroundBytes] / [backgroundCapBytes] — the shared background bitmap pool, evicted on its own
 *   line by `trimBackgroundsLocked`. **Native heap** (minSdk 29, so bitmap pixels are always native).
 * - [bitmapBytes] — the per-page windowed screen bitmaps. **Native heap**, and on *no* budget line
 *   at all: they are `SoftReference`s that ART reclaims under pressure.
 *
 * Consequently [entryBytes] is the only counted line inside [usedHeapBytes], and the two bitmap
 * pools are counted inside [nativeHeapBytes]. Mixing them into one "used memory" number hides the
 * pool that is actually large.
 *
 * Counted and measured figures come from different sources and can disagree — see
 * [heapOverAccounted] and [nativeOverAccounted], which say so rather than letting the leftover
 * silently clamp to zero.
