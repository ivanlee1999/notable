 *
 * - A [com.ethran.notable.data.db.StrokePoint] is a data class whose optional fields
 *   (pressure/tiltX/tiltY/dt) are boxed; a typical Onyx point is an object header plus several
 *   boxed wrappers, ~100 B. We charge [BYTES_PER_POINT] per point.
 * - Each [com.ethran.notable.data.db.Stroke] adds an object, its bounding box, id string and list
 *   header — [BYTES_PER_STROKE].
 * - An [com.ethran.notable.data.db.Image] row is metadata only (the bitmap is windowed separately),
 *   so [BYTES_PER_IMAGE] is small.
 *
 * These are counting constants, not a claim of exact heap layout; calibrate against the
 * estimate/actual telemetry (see [PageDataManager] admission logging).
